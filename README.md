## The goal
- Free and Open source forever
- Realistic physics
- Very performant (should easily run on integrated gpu's with the right settings), but also allow nice visuals if your computer can handle it.
- user created maps and drone parts (created in the Godot Editor)

## Current working features:
- Drone physics (this will probably keep getting improved during development)
    - PID controllers
    - ground effect simulation
- 1 debug map
- Input settings menu
- (very basic) simulator settings menu
